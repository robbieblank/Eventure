# Eventure
An app that uses the ticketmaster API to link people to events in a major city of their choice. Built as a part of Google CSSI. 
I wrote all of the Javascript and the front page. My team worked on the CSS and the "Saved Events" page. 

# Running the App
Clone the project and open "index.html"

1. Search for a city
2. View events, buy tickets by clicking on the hyperlink of them.
3. Save events by clicking the buttom, and view your saved events by navigating to the according tab.
4. Filter events by type by using the buttons at the top of the events list.
