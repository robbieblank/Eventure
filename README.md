# Eventure
An app that uses the ticketmaster API to link people to events in a major city of their choice. Built as a part of Google CSSI. 
I wrote all of the Javascript and the front page. My team worked on the CSS and the "Saved Events" page. 

# Running the App
Download the project and open "index.html"
